    <h2>1. Losing interest in learning</h2>
    <p>The joy of learning is simply beautiful, especially during the early years. 
    Children often look forward to finishing kindergarten, excited to move on to Year 1 and embrace new experiences. However, for some, this excitement is short-lived.</p>
    <p>When formal learning begins, these children are expected to read, write, and count. But how can they enjoy learning if they are unable to read when asked? 
    How can they participate if they donâ€™t know how to spell? This inability leads to frustration, and over time, school becomes a burden for them. The excitement and fun of learning fade away.</p> 

    <h2>2. Going to "Kelas Pemulihan"</h2>
    <p>Going to "Kelas pemulihan" is often the reality for children who can't read yet. Teachers in regular schools may not have the special skills needed to help struggling readers. 
    Additionally, classrooms often include students with various learning needs, making it hard for teachers to give individual attention </p>
    <p>As a result, remedial classes become the go-to solution. Parents should pay attention and seek help if their child is still unable to read, as early intervention can make a difference.</p>

    <h2>3. Self-esteem is Decreasing.</h2>
    <p>When children struggle with reading, it can deeply affect their self-esteem, potentially leading to an inferiority complex. 
    This is an important psychological issue that often goes unnoticed by parents. The inability to read can cause children to lose confidence in themselves.</p>
    <p>If this continues unchecked, it could result in more severe mental health challenges, with children displaying negative changes in their character and behavior.
    Early intervention and support are essential to prevent this decline.</p>
